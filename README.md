# InvoTech-IT-Training Web Application (using HTML5 and SASS)
## Description
In this project, I am implementing an IT training website using advance HTML and SASS. This is an assignment based project. The objective of this assignment is to demonstrate proficiency in advanced CSS and  HTML techniques to create a responsive and visually appealing website.

### How to run project :

1. Clone Project Repository : 

   Clone a project repository from GITHUB to your local system.

2. Start a Local Server : 

   open root folder of web app in vs code and press `f5`or `f10` to run project locally. 

3. I have compiled the sass file and converted it into css file. If you want to make change in the SASS file then, you have to install SASS compiler by running the following command:

   i. "npm install -g sass"

   ii. Then run the following command:
  
        sass --watch fileName.sass fileName.css

4. Here you have done all things. Now enjoy the running of your code. Thank you!
